# PoliCalibration


This repository contains the original implementation of the polimetric
calibration paper **A practical calibration method for RGB micro-grid**
**polarimetric cameras**, submitted to RA-L/IROS 2022.

# Code <a name="code-section"></a>
In this folder, the paper implementation code is included. It consists of
C++ code with the developed method, and some raw images to test its
performance.

NOTE: The code is not provided yet. It will be submitted once the paper has
been accepted to the conference.

# Supplementary documents <a name="supdocs"></a>
In this folder, extra PDF documents have been added to detail some theoretical
demonstrations that for space reasons could not be included in the paper.
Nevertheless, these explanations are not part of the paper. The main text stands
by itself, but some mathematical demonstrations are not included in it since
they are not part of the aim of the paper. These explanations are addressed
to the readers who want to know the exact details of some phenomenoms
developed in our method.

# Supplementary images <a name="supimgs"></a>
In this folder, images that could not be included in the paper are attached.
Since the RGB channels from the image are considered as three separated images,
then there are three different calibration results. In most part of the paper,
only the red channel results are shown. In this folder, the results for the red,
green and blue channels can be found.
