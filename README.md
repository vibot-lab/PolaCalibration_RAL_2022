# PoliCalibration


This repository contains the original implementation of the polimetric
calibration paper **"A practical calibration method for RGB micro-grid**
**polarimetric cameras"**, submitted to RA-L/IROS 2022.

# [Code](Code/)
In this folder, the paper implementation code is included. It consists of
C++ code with the developed method, and some raw images to test its
performance.

NOTE: The code will be provided after the reviewing process decision.

# [Supplementary documents](Supplementary_documents/)
In this folder, we detail the theoretical
demonstration about the angle of polarization error which due to space reasons could not be included in the main paper.
Nevertheless, these explanations are not part of the paper. The main text stands
by itself. These explanations are addressed
to the readers who want to know the additional details of the calibration modelling presented in the main paper.

# [Supplementary images](Supplementary_images)
In this folder, images that could not be included in the paper are attached.
Since the RGB channels from the image are considered as three separated images,
then there are three different calibration results per frame. We have presented the red channel results in the paper, while in this folder includes the analysis for the red, green and blue channels.
